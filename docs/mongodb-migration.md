# MongoDB Migration Work

## Things to consider:

* build index based off common queries. writes will have bad performance if there are many indexes
* timestamps are in <string> UTC and <string>EST/EDT so need to convert them to JS Date Object UTC when we do the mapping

I think these doc types are not needed
* doc.type : 'asc'


## database models and Cloudant <-> MongoDB schema mapping

* not porting over docs with 'delete' docStatus

### users

### teams (bottom up tree structure)
Possible tree structure pattern to explore:
* [Model Tree Structures with an Array of Ancestors]
* [Model Tree Structures with Materialized Paths] <- use this one
* [Model Tree Structures with Parent References]

in cloudant it currently looks like each team has all it's ancestors. Also each team knows about all it's immediate children.
This seems problematic when it comes to updating tree structure and removing subtrees.

use team name in string path to make the data readable. enforce no duplicate team name case insensitive, trim leading/trailing whitespace.
and update to a team name might be expensive if its high up in the tree.


* _id is going to be a transformation of team name ```str.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z1-9]/g, â€˜')```. its going to be the value that is used in path

"type": "team"

| Fields        | Details       | mongo ex    | cloudant field | cloudant value ex

### assessments

these two fields seem to be empty for every document in production, i don't think they are used so not going to set the fields in mongo.

### snapshots (roll-up data)

* don't need to port data; create new schema w/ mongoose

## Proposed work
* Use Mongoose
* Have alternate versions of assessment.js, iteration.js, snapshot.js, teams.js and users.js in a new model directory
* Move validation from validate.js -> [using mongoose schema validation]
* Use mongoose default fields and remove the various default data spread throughout the project (e.x public/index.js ~L5->114)

###Steps

####First Phase

1. Migrate data
  1. ```$ curl http://admin:pass@domain/dbName/_all_docs?include_docs=true > docs.json  ``` get all docs
  2. run scripts using a mongo driver over docs differentiate the docs using  "type" field. save mapping into compose
2. Develop models with migrated data

####Second Phase
1. run scripts to convert cloudantIds to mongo's objectId


* develop and test in a seperate app and branch. once we have working model & scripts, we turn off prod for maintenance for as long as it takes to port prod
