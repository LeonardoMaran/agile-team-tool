# Agile Team Tool [![Build Status](https://travis.ibm.com/AgileAcademy/agile-team-tool-nodejs.svg?token=GEQPqR4dViSH8CpMeuaS&branch=master)](https://travis.ibm.com/AgileAcademy/agile-team-tool-nodejs)

A web app enabling teams to track and analyze progress on their journey of maturing as an Agile team. You can visit the tool [here](https://ibm.biz/AgileTeamTool).

## Overview

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project on your local machine, you have a couple of options. You can either run [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) on your machine, or you can use Docker to run everything for you.

Make sure to execute `npm install` first for module dependencies

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
This project uses Node.js version 6.x. We recommend installing Node.js via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). With nvm, you can install the correct version of Node.js using `nvm use node`, which installs the latest version.

### [Redis](https://redis.io/)
Redis is used for session management.

### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
Data are stored in JSON-like documents using MongoDB.

### [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
Application UI is built using the ReactJS framework.

#### [IBM v18 Northstar](http://ibmdev.webmaster.ibm.com/resources/index.php?filter=v18)
Along with the custom styling used to implement the current UI, most of the default styling is based on IBM's v18 Northstar framework. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is also packaged as part of the framework.

#### [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
Highcharts is used to graph metrics relevant to the tool.

#### Starting the Development Server
The most simple setup, using default environment variable values:

```
npm install
npm start
```
A bit of a better setup might be something like the following, where you can change environment variables:

```
npm install
logColors=true redisHost=172.17.0.2 redisPort=6379 NODE_ENV=production nodemon ./bin/www
```
#### Testing Locally
```
gulp test
```
### Running the app with docker

1. Make sure docker and docker-compose is installed in your local machine
2. Run the project by doing `docker-compose up -d`
3. Access the app via http://{docker ip}:3000


## Deployment

* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

### Jobs

There are 3 jobs running on separate deployments using the same base code.  These are to:
1. Rollup squad iteration data to their parents.
2. Mark iteration as `Complete` if it is past end date.
3. Mark member information if they no longer exist in Bluepages.
